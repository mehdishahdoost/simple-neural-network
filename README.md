## What is MSE (mean squared error), loss function or error function

The network needs a function that compares its predictions against the known good answers. This function is known as the error, or loss function. A common loss function is the mean squared error function.

Mean squared error (MSE) measures the amount of error in statistical models. . When a model has no error, the MSE equals zero. As model error increases, its value increases.
